    <h2>Daniel Wolf</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone, I know this is late but I'm Daniel Wolf this is my fourth semester and second online semester at BYU-I.
        I'm majoring in Computer Science and Engineering and have spent pretty much all of my life around computers and have been
        told that I'm good with them. I tend to spend a lot of my time playing video games and drawing, notably I've competed in
        both Super Smash Bros. and offical Pokemon VGC tournaments.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church for my whole life and plan to be going on mission soon. If everything goes as planned
        I will be able to turn my papers in around February.</p>
